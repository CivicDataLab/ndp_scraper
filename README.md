# Scraper 
This code is intended to scrape [data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in/catalogs) website catalogs and dump the result into formatted csv file. scraper_main.py should be run inorder to start scraping the website. 

## Assumptions that may affect the code in the future
* XPATHS - all xpaths are working for now. If the site gets updated, xpaths may need an update. 
* Number of pages i.e. PAGES_TO_TRAVERSE_IN_SITE in variables.py file.
